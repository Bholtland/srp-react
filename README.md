PREFACE
-------------------
Learning ReactJS was one of the things on my "coding" list. It's popularity lead to adoption in many apps and companies. 
For me, learning React has a lot of reasons. Of course it's nice to have a better chance at getting hired, but besides that, i wanted to make a switch from regular web development to component-based web development, since i believe that is the future. It's also a nice entrance toward mobile app development with React Native.

WHAT DID I DO?
-------------------
I started of with a course on Codecademy. I spent most of the time doing that. For me the overall picture of React development was hard to see at first. It seemed a bit inefficient. When i saw the power of reusing components, my mind made a switch. After doing the Codecademy course, i browsed for some good learning projects on working with ReactJS. One of the most common projects is making a to-do list. If that's a popular choice, then why not do that. Also, it's a nice and easy way of seeing reusable components at work and playing with what React has to offer.

I used tutorials, which i'll list below, on how to make a to-do list. At this point i still find it hard to write React without any help, but yeah, we all ask for help on Stackoverflow once in a while.

INSPIRATION
------------------
What i learned from React is more than the language itself. I fell in love with the way of thinking. I started looking into other ways of writing modular code, like vanilla Javascript components, AngularJS and VUEJs. Of course not every project has to be modular. A simple portfolio website works great in standard HTML & CSS, but because i want to work on apps more often, this is a new world for me with infinite possibilities.
